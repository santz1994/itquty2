  - Added indexes for assets (status_division_idx, assigned_status_idx)
  - Optimized daily_activities with user_date_idx for efficient queries
  - Added composite indexes for asset_requests and model_has_roles tables
- **Impact:** Significantly improved query performance for dashboard and reporting operations

#### 2. Role-based UI Integration
- **Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- **Implementation:**
  - Migrated from `@role` to `@can` directives for granular permission control
  - Updated sidebar navigation with 33 specific permissions
  - Added new menu items for KPI Dashboard, Reports, and Import/Export
  - Integrated permission gates for all administrative functions
- **Impact:** Enhanced security with fine-grained access control

#### 3. Enhanced Model Functionality
- **Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- **Implementation:**
  - **Ticket Model:** Added 8 accessors/mutators (status_badge, priority_color, is_overdue, time_to_sla) and 15 helper methods (assignTo, markFirstResponse, resolve, close, reopen)
  - **Asset Model:** Added 9 accessors/mutators (formatted_mac_address, warranty_expiry_date, depreciation_percentage, status_badge) and 12 helper methods (assignTo, unassign, markForMaintenance, dispose)
  - **User Model:** Added 7 accessors/mutators (initials, primary_role, role_color, is_online) and 8 helper methods (getPerformanceMetrics, getWorkload, canManageUsers)
  - **DailyActivity Model:** Added 6 accessors/mutators (type_badge, formatted_duration, is_today) and 5 helper methods (markCompleted, addDuration, getUserActivitySummary)
- **Impact:** Dramatically improved model functionality with modern Laravel 10 patterns

#### 4. Advanced Features Implementation
- **Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- **Implementation:**
  - **Notification System:** Complete notification infrastructure with Notification model, migration, and relationships
  - **NotificationService:** Automated checks for overdue tickets, expiring warranties, system alerts, and daily digests
  - **NotificationController:** Full CRUD operations with AJAX support for real-time updates
  - **Console Command:** `notifications:check` command with scheduling for automated monitoring
  - **UI Components:** Comprehensive notification view with filtering, status management, and statistics
  - **Integration:** Automatic notifications for ticket assignments, asset assignments, and system events
- **Testing:** Created 4 test notifications, verified command functionality, confirmed database operations
- **Impact:** Real-time notification system for proactive asset and ticket management

### üîß Technical Implementation Details

#### Database Schema Enhancements
```sql
-- Key performance indexes added
CREATE INDEX tickets_priority_sla_idx ON tickets (ticket_priority_id, sla_due);
CREATE INDEX assets_status_division_idx ON assets (status_id, division_id);
CREATE INDEX daily_activities_user_date_idx ON daily_activities (user_id, activity_date);
CREATE INDEX notifications_user_read_idx ON notifications (user_id, is_read);
```

#### Permission-Based Navigation
```php
// Migration from role-based to permission-based
@role(['admin', 'super-admin']) -> @can('view-assets')
@role(['management']) -> @can('view-kpi-dashboard')
```

#### Advanced Model Methods
```php
// Example enhanced functionality
$ticket->assignTo($user, 'automatic'); // Auto-creates notification
$asset->assignTo($user); // Logs activity and notifies user
$user->getPerformanceMetrics(30); // 30-day performance analysis
$notification->markAsRead(); // Updates read status with timestamp
```

#### Automated Monitoring
```bash
# Scheduled console commands
php artisan notifications:check --overdue --warranty  # Hourly
php artisan notifications:check --cleanup            # Daily at 2 AM
php artisan notifications:check --digest             # Daily at 8 AM
```
