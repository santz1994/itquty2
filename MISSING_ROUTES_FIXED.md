# Missing Routes Fixed

## Issue
Multiple pages were showing route errors like:
- "Route [assets.create] not defined" 
- "Route [assets.show] not defined"
- "Route [admin.assets.index] not defined"
- And many others

## Root Cause
Views were referencing routes that weren't defined in the routes/web.php file. The application had controllers with the necessary methods, but the routes weren't properly registered.

## Routes Added

### Assets Routes (CRUD)
- ✅ `assets.create` → GET /assets/create → AssetsController@create
- ✅ `assets.show` → GET /assets/{asset} → AssetsController@show  
- ✅ `assets.edit` → GET /assets/{asset}/edit → AssetsController@edit
- ✅ `assets.update` → PUT/PATCH /assets/{asset} → AssetsController@update
- ✅ `assets.destroy` → DELETE /assets/{asset} → AssetsController@destroy
- ✅ `assets.store` → POST /assets → AssetsController@store
- ✅ `assets.ticket-history` → GET /assets/{asset}/ticket-history → AssetsController@history

### Admin Routes
- ✅ `admin.assets.index` → GET /admin/assets → InventoryController@index
- ✅ `admin.tickets.show` → GET /admin/tickets/{ticket} → TicketController@show

### Asset Maintenance Routes
- ✅ `asset-maintenance.show` → GET /asset-maintenance/{asset} → AssetMaintenanceController@show

## Implementation Details

### 1. Assets Resource Route
Added a resource route for assets with the index route excluded (since it was already defined):
```php
Route::resource('assets', \App\Http\Controllers\AssetsController::class)->except(['index']);
```

### 2. Asset History Route
Added specific route for asset ticket history:
```php
Route::get('/assets/{asset}/ticket-history', [\App\Http\Controllers\AssetsController::class, 'history'])->name('assets.ticket-history');
```

### 3. Admin Routes
Added admin-specific routes in the web middleware group:
```php
Route::get('/admin/assets', [\App\Http\Controllers\InventoryController::class, 'index'])->name('admin.assets.index');
Route::get('/admin/tickets/{ticket}', [\App\Http\Controllers\TicketController::class, 'show'])->name('admin.tickets.show');
```

### 4. Asset Maintenance Show Route
Added the missing show route for asset maintenance:
```php
Route::get('/asset-maintenance/{asset}', [\App\Http\Controllers\AssetMaintenanceController::class, 'show'])->name('asset-maintenance.show');
```

## Views That Should Now Work

### Inventory Management
- ✅ `/resources/views/inventory/index.blade.php` - "Create Asset" button should work
- ✅ Asset edit, view, and ticket history buttons should work
- ✅ All asset CRUD operations should be functional

### Admin Views
- ✅ `/resources/views/admin/assets/history.blade.php` - Admin asset links should work
- ✅ Admin ticket views should be accessible

### Asset Maintenance
- ✅ `/resources/views/asset-maintenance/index.blade.php` - Asset detail links should work

### Dashboard & Activities
- ✅ `/resources/views/dashboard/integrated-dashboard.blade.php` - Ticket links should work
- ✅ `/resources/views/daily-activities/index.blade.php` - All ticket references should work

## Testing Verification

Run these commands to verify routes are registered:

```bash
# Check all assets routes
php artisan route:list --name=assets

# Check admin routes  
php artisan route:list --name=admin

# Check asset-maintenance routes
php artisan route:list --name=asset-maintenance
```

## Next Steps

1. **Test Navigation**: Visit http://192.168.1.122/assets and verify all buttons work
2. **Test Forms**: Try creating/editing assets to ensure forms submit properly
3. **Test Admin Pages**: Verify admin asset and ticket pages load correctly  
4. **Test Asset Maintenance**: Check that asset detail views work properly

## Controllers Used

- **AssetsController**: Full CRUD operations for assets
- **InventoryController**: Asset listing and inventory management
- **TicketController**: Ticket viewing and management
- **AssetMaintenanceController**: Asset maintenance operations

All these controllers already existed with the necessary methods, we just needed to register the routes properly.
