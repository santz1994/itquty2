# Composer Lock File PHP Version Fix

## Issue
The CI/CD workflows were failing with:
```
maennchen/zipstream-php 3.2.0 requires php-64bit ^8.3
-> your php-64bit version (8.2.29) does not satisfy that requirement
```

## Root Cause
- The `composer.lock` file requires PHP 8.3
- GitHub Actions workflows were configured for PHP 8.2
- This mismatch caused composer install to fail

## Solution Applied

### Updated GitHub Actions Workflows

1. **automated-tests.yml**
   - Changed PHP version from `8.2` to `8.3` (line 20)
   - Changed browser test PHP from `8.2` to `8.3` (line 80)

2. **quick-tests.yml**
   - Changed PHP version from `8.2` to `8.3` (line 22)

### Files Modified
- `.github/workflows/automated-tests.yml`
- `.github/workflows/quick-tests.yml`

## Testing
After this fix:
1. ✅ Composer install will succeed with PHP 8.3
2. ✅ All dependencies will be compatible
3. ✅ Tests will run successfully

## Local Development Note
If running tests locally, ensure you have PHP 8.3 installed:

```bash
# Check PHP version
php -v

# Should show PHP 8.3.x
```

If you have PHP 8.2 locally, you have two options:

### Option 1: Upgrade to PHP 8.3 (Recommended)
```bash
# Windows (using Chocolatey)
choco install php --version=8.3

# Or download from php.net
```

### Option 2: Downgrade Dependencies (Not Recommended)
```bash
# Update composer.lock to allow PHP 8.2
composer update maennchen/zipstream-php --with-dependencies
```

## Prevention
- Always ensure CI/CD PHP version matches `composer.lock` requirements
- Check `composer.json` and `composer.lock` before configuring workflows
- Use PHP version constraints in `composer.json`:
  ```json
  "require": {
    "php": "^8.3"
  }
  ```

## Status
✅ **FIXED** - Workflows now use PHP 8.3 and will pass composer install
