Ticket input ideas for IT support
An integrated ticketing system should be designed to gather essential information upfront, reducing back-and-forth communication. 
Initial ticket submission
1. User self-service portal: Allow users to submit tickets. The interface should have clear fields for:
- Problem category: A dropdown menu for common issues (e.g., "Software," "Hardware," "Network").
- Urgency/priority: Let the user indicate the impact level (e.g., "Critical" for a full system outage, "Low" for a minor bug).
- Problem description: A text box for a detailed explanation.

2. Integrated asset details
- User-to-asset linking: When a user creates a ticket, the system should automatically identify and display the assets assigned to that user.
- Asset history: Allow admin/agents to see an asset's complete ticket history directly from the new ticket. This includes past repairs, upgrades, and previous issues.
- Affected asset selection: Include a dropdown or search function to allow the user or admin/agents to quickly associate the ticket with a specific asset, such as a laptop or printer.

3. Daily activity tracking ideas
- Status updates: Every time a admin/agents takes an action, the ticket status should be updated automatically (e.g., "In Progress," "Pending User Response").
- Time tracking: Include an integrated timer that logs the time a admin/agents spends working on a ticket. This data is valuable for performance metrics and cost analysis.
- admin/agents notes: Require admin/agents to add clear, detailed notes after each interaction or action. This maintains a robust log of the resolution process.
- Resolution logging: When a ticket is closed, require the admin/agents to log the final resolution, which can then be used to build a knowledge base for future issues.

Example workflow: User reports a broken laptop
1. User submits a ticket: A user, Jane Doe, logs into the self-service portal and reports that her laptop won't turn on.
2. System integrates asset data: When Jane selects the "Hardware" category, the system automatically retrieves her assigned laptop and displays its key information, such as the asset tag, model, and last service date.
3. admin/agents receives the ticket: An IT admin/agents, John Smith, is assigned the new ticket.
4. admin/agents performs diagnostics: John opens the ticket and reviews the laptop's asset history. He sees a similar issue was reported two months ago and logs his initial diagnostic steps as a new daily activity note.
5. admin/agents updates asset status: John finds a faulty power supply and marks the asset as "In Repair."
6. Ticket closure: After replacing the power supply, John closes the ticket. He adds the final resolution to the ticket, logs the time spent on the repair, and the asset's status is automatically changed back to "Active". The detailed repair steps are added to the knowledge base for future reference.
