## 🎯 Models with Auditing Enabled

The following models now automatically track all changes:
- ✅ **Ticket** - All create/update/delete operations logged
- ✅ **Asset** - All create/update/delete operations logged
- ✅ **User** - All create/update/delete operations logged

**To add auditing to new models:**
```php
use App\Traits\Auditable;

class YourModel extends Model {
    use Auditable;
}
```

---

## 📝 What Gets Logged

### Model Actions
- **Create**: New record creation with all field values
- **Update**: Changes to existing records (old vs new values)
- **Delete**: Record deletion with final values
- **Restore**: Soft-deleted record restoration (if using soft deletes)

### Authentication Events
- **Login**: Successful user login
- **Logout**: User logout
- **Failed Login**: Failed login attempts with attempted email
- **Password Reset**: Password reset actions
- **Registration**: New user registration

### HTTP Requests
- **POST**: Create operations
- **PUT/PATCH**: Update operations
- **DELETE**: Delete operations

**Excluded from logging:**
- GET requests (read-only)
- Audit log view routes (prevent recursive logging)
- Debug tools (_debugbar, telescope)

---

## 🔒 Security Features

1. **Sensitive Data Redaction**
   - Passwords, tokens, secrets automatically replaced with `[REDACTED]`
   
2. **Tamper-Evident**
   - Append-only design (no updates to audit logs)
   - User attribution on all actions
   - Timestamp immutability

3. **Access Control**
   - Viewing: super-admin or admin only
   - Cleanup: super-admin only
   - My Logs API: User can only see their own actions

4. **Data Protection**
   - SQL injection prevention (Eloquent ORM)
   - XSS prevention (Blade templating)
   - CSRF protection (Laravel middleware)

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### Viewing Audit Logs
1. Navigate to: `http://yourapp.com/audit-logs`
2. Use filters to find specific logs
3. Click "View Details" to see full information
4. Export to CSV for external analysis

### Adding Auditing to a Model
```php
// 1. Add trait to your model
use App\Traits\Auditable;

class Invoice extends Model {
    use Auditable;
}

// 2. Optional: Specify fields to audit
protected $auditableAttributes = [
    'invoice_number',
    'amount',
    'status'
];
```

### Manual Logging
```php
use App\Services\AuditLogService;

$auditLog = new AuditLogService();

// Log a system action
$auditLog->logSystemAction(
    'config_update',
    'Email settings were updated',
    $oldConfig,
    $newConfig
);
```

### Querying Audit Logs
```php
// Get all changes to a ticket
$logs = AuditLog::byModelType('App\Ticket')
    ->where('model_id', 123)
    ->orderBy('created_at', 'desc')
    ->get();

// Get all deletions today
$deletions = AuditLog::byAction('delete')
    ->whereDate('created_at', today())
    ->get();

// Get user activity this month
$activity = AuditLog::byUser(5)
    ->whereMonth('created_at', now()->month)
    ->get();
```

## 📊 Database Schema

### audit_logs Table
```
id                 - Primary key
user_id            - Who performed the action (nullable, FK to users)
action             - Action type (create, update, delete, login, etc.)
model_type         - Model class (e.g., 'App\Ticket')
model_id           - Model record ID
old_values         - JSON of old values before change
new_values         - JSON of new values after change
ip_address         - Client IP address
user_agent         - Browser/client user agent
description        - Human-readable description
event_type         - Category (model, auth, system)
created_at         - Timestamp
updated_at         - Timestamp

Indexes: user_id, model_type, model_id, action, (model_type, model_id), created_at
```

## 💡 Usage Examples

### Example 1: Track Who Changed Ticket Priority
```php
// View all priority changes for a ticket
$logs = AuditLog::byModelType('App\Ticket')
    ->where('model_id', 123)
    ->get()
    ->filter(function($log) {
        $changes = $log->changes;
        return isset($changes['priority_id']);
    });

foreach ($logs as $log) {
    echo "{$log->user->name} changed priority from {$changes['priority_id']['old']} to {$changes['priority_id']['new']} on {$log->created_at}";
}
```

### Example 2: Monitor Failed Login Attempts
```php
// Get all failed logins in last 24 hours
$failedLogins = AuditLog::byAction('failed_login')
    ->where('created_at', '>=', now()->subDay())
    ->get();

// Check for brute force attempts (same IP, multiple failures)
$attempts = $failedLogins->groupBy('ip_address');
foreach ($attempts as $ip => $logs) {
    if ($logs->count() > 5) {
        // Alert: Possible brute force attack from $ip
    }
}
```

### Example 3: Audit Trail for Compliance
```php
// Export all asset changes for audit period
$logs = AuditLog::byModelType('App\Asset')
    ->dateRange('2025-01-01', '2025-12-31')
    ->get();

// Generate compliance report
foreach ($logs as $log) {
    // Include: who, what, when, before/after values
}
```

## 📈 Performance Metrics

### Database Performance
- ✅ 6 indexes for fast queries
- ✅ Foreign key on user_id for referential integrity
- ✅ Composite index for model lookups

### Query Efficiency
- ✅ Pagination: 50 records per page
- ✅ Eager loading: User relationship preloaded
- ✅ Scopes: Reusable query conditions
- ✅ Chunking: Export processes 500 records at a time

### Expected Performance
- Index page load: < 500ms (with 10,000 logs)
- Filter query: < 200ms
- CSV export: ~1,000 logs/second
- Detail page: < 100ms

---

## 🔧 Maintenance

### Regular Cleanup
Schedule automatic cleanup via Laravel scheduler:

```php
// app/Console/Kernel.php
protected function schedule(Schedule $schedule)
{
    $schedule->call(function () {
        $auditLog = new AuditLogService();
        $deleted = $auditLog->cleanupOldLogs(90); // Keep 90 days
        Log::info("Cleaned up {$deleted} old audit logs");
    })->monthly();
}
```

### Manual Cleanup
Admin can use the cleanup feature in the UI:
1. Go to `/audit-logs`
2. Click "Cleanup Old Logs" (super-admin only)
3. Select retention period (30-365 days)
4. Confirm deletion

## 📞 Support

### Common Issues

**Q: Audit logs not appearing?**
- Check if model has `Auditable` trait
- Verify user is authenticated
- Check `storage/logs/laravel.log` for errors

**Q: Permission denied?**
- Ensure user has admin or super-admin role
- Run: `php artisan permission:cache-reset`

**Q: Export timing out?**
- Increase PHP max_execution_time
- Export smaller date ranges
- Check server memory limit
