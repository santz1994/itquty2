## 🔍 Verification Results

### Route Loading Test

```powershell

```

### Sample Route Verification

**Ticket Routes:**

3. **Security**: Debug routes only load in local environment
4. **Performance**: Cleaner route loading, easier to cache
5. **Scalability**: Easy to add new modules without cluttering main file
6. **Testing**: Clear separation makes testing easier

## 📝 Notes

- Original file backed up at `routes/web.php.backup`
- All route names unchanged (zero breaking changes for views)
- Middleware groups preserved correctly
- Debug routes safely isolated to local environment only
- All caches cleared and routes verified working

## ✅ Ready for Next Phase
