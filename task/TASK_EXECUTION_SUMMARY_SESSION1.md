## 📋 NEXT IMMEDIATE ACTIONS

### Priority 1: Critical Refactoring
**Task:** Split TicketController (708 lines → 5 smaller controllers)

**Plan:**
```
TicketController (708 lines) → Split into:

1. TicketController (~150 lines)
   - CRUD operations
   - Export/Print

2. TicketTimerController (~80 lines)
   - startTimer
   - stopTimer
   - getTimerStatus

3. TicketStatusController (~100 lines)
   - updateStatus
   - complete
   - completeWithResolution

4. TicketAssignmentController (~120 lines)
   - assign
   - selfAssign
   - forceAssign

5. TicketFilterController (~100 lines)
   - unassigned
   - overdue
   - myTickets
```

**Estimated Time:** 4 hours  
**Impact:** High - Improves maintainability significantly

---

### Priority 2: Component Migration
**Task:** Migrate to modern page-header component

**Steps:**
1. Find all files using `partials/page-header`
2. Convert to `components/page-header`
3. Test each converted page
4. Delete `partials/page-header.blade.php`

**Estimated Time:** 1 hour  
**Impact:** Medium - Code consistency

---

### Priority 3: Smoke Testing
**Task:** Quick functional testing of all major features

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Login as different roles (user, admin, super-admin, management)
- [ ] Test dashboard loads
- [ ] Click through all menu items
- [ ] Test global search (Ctrl+K)
- [ ] Check browser console for errors

**Estimated Time:** 30 minutes  
**Impact:** High - Identifies breaking issues

---

### Priority 4: Navigation Verification
**Task:** Verify all menu items and permissions

**Focus Areas:**
- [ ] Assets section (All Assets, My Assets, Scan QR)
- [ ] Asset Requests section (All Requests, New Request)
- [ ] Tickets section (All Tickets, Create Ticket)
- [ ] Daily Activity (List, Calendar, Reports)
- [ ] Audit Logs (admin/super-admin only)
- [ ] SLA Management (super-admin only)
- [ ] Management Dashboard (management role)
- [ ] System Settings (super-admin only)

**Estimated Time:** 1 hour  
**Impact:** Critical - User accessibility
