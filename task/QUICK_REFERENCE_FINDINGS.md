## 🎓 RECOMMENDED APPROACH

**1. Backup First**
```powershell
git checkout -b feature/code-cleanup
git add -A
git commit -m "Backup before refactoring"
```

**2. Refactor TicketController**
- One controller at a time
- Test after each split
- Update routes as you go

**3. Test Everything**
```powershell
php artisan test
```

**4. Proceed to Phase 2**
- Ticket features testing
- Asset features testing
- Continue cleanup in parallel
