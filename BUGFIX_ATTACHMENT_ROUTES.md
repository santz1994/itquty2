# BUGFIX: Attachment Routes Missing - RESOLVED ‚úÖ

**Date:** October 15, 2025  
**Issue:** RouteNotFoundException - Route [attachments.bulk-upload] not defined  
**Status:** FIXED  

---

## üêõ Problem

When accessing `/tickets/2`, the application threw a 500 error:
```
Route [attachments.bulk-upload] not defined. 
(View: D:\Project\ITQuty\Quty1\resources\views\partials\file-uploader.blade.php)
```

**Root Cause:** The attachment routes were never added to `routes/web.php`, even though:
- ‚úÖ AttachmentController was created
- ‚úÖ File-uploader component was created and integrated into views
- ‚ùå Routes were documented but NOT added to web.php

---

## üîß Solution Applied

### 1. Added Missing Routes to `routes/web.php` (lines ~168-174)

```php
// File Attachments Routes
Route::post('/attachments/upload', [\App\Http\Controllers\AttachmentController::class, 'upload'])->name('attachments.upload');
Route::post('/attachments/bulk-upload', [\App\Http\Controllers\AttachmentController::class, 'bulkUpload'])->name('attachments.bulk-upload');
Route::get('/attachments', [\App\Http\Controllers\AttachmentController::class, 'index'])->name('attachments.index');
Route::get('/attachments/{id}/download', [\App\Http\Controllers\AttachmentController::class, 'download'])->name('attachments.download');
Route::delete('/attachments/{id}', [\App\Http\Controllers\AttachmentController::class, 'destroy'])->name('attachments.destroy');
```

**Location:** Inside the `Route::middleware(['auth'])` group, after notification routes

### 2. Updated Model Type Validation

**File:** `app/Http/Controllers/AttachmentController.php`

**Changed:**
```php
// OLD - only accepted 'maintenance'
'model_type' => 'required|in:asset,ticket,maintenance',

// NEW - accepts both 'maintenance' and 'maintenance_log'
'model_type' => 'required|in:asset,ticket,maintenance,maintenance_log',
```

**Applied to:**
- `upload()` method (line ~23)
- `bulkUpload()` method (line ~204)

### 3. Updated getModel() Method

**Added case for `maintenance_log`:**
```php
case 'maintenance':
case 'maintenance_log':  // ‚Üê NEW
    return AssetMaintenanceLog::find($id);
```

This allows the view to use either `maintenance` or `maintenance_log` as the model type.

## üìã Files Modified

1. ‚úÖ `routes/web.php`
   - Added 5 attachment routes (lines ~168-174)

2. ‚úÖ `app/Http/Controllers/AttachmentController.php`
   - Updated validation in `upload()` method
   - Updated validation in `bulkUpload()` method  
   - Updated `getModel()` method to handle `maintenance_log` type

## ‚úÖ Testing Checklist

- [ ] Navigate to `/tickets/2` - Should load without errors
- [ ] Verify "Attachments" box appears on ticket page
- [ ] Try uploading a file to a ticket - Should work
- [ ] Navigate to `/maintenance/1` - Should load without errors
- [ ] Verify tabbed attachments appear (Before Photos, After Photos, Receipts)
- [ ] Try uploading files to each tab - Should work
- [ ] Test file download - Should work
- [ ] Test file delete - Should work

---

## üéØ Status

**ERROR RESOLVED** ‚úÖ

The application should now:
1. Load ticket/maintenance detail pages without route errors
2. Display file uploader components correctly
3. Allow file uploads, downloads, and deletions
4. Support both `maintenance` and `maintenance_log` as model types

---

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Test the fix:**
   - Visit http://192.168.1.122/tickets/2
   - Verify page loads successfully
   - Test file upload functionality

2. **Resume Task #2:**
   - Complete model creation for database tables
   - Run migrations
   - Continue with remaining todos

**Time to Resolution:** ~5 minutes  
**Impact:** Critical (blocked all file attachment functionality)  
**Lesson:** Always add routes immediately after creating controllers to avoid integration issues!
