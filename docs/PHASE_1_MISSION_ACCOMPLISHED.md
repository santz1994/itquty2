## 🔧 Technical Changes Made

### 1. Asset Model (app/Asset.php)
**What:** Fixed relationships and added purchase order support
```php
✅ Added purchaseOrder() relationship
✅ Fixed tickets() from hasMany → belongsToMany
✅ Added withTickets() eager-loading scope
✅ Enhanced withRelations() to include purchaseOrder
```

### 2. Ticket Model (app/Ticket.php)
**What:** Added asset synchronization helper
```php
✅ Added syncAssets() method for fluent asset management
```

### 3. Validation (Form Requests)
**What:** Fixed serial number NULL handling and added asset_ids support
```php
✅ StoreAssetRequest: Fixed serial validation with whereNotNull()
✅ UpdateTicketRequest: Added asset_ids[] validation
```

### 4. Views (Blade Templates)
**What:** Removed duplicate form fields and cleaned up UX
```
✅ create.blade.php: Removed 3 duplicate fields, added purchase order
✅ edit.blade.php: Removed 2 duplicate fields
```

### 5. Discovery: Already Implemented ✅
**What:** Found and verified these were already working
```
✅ Multi-asset ticket creation (ticket create/edit views + service)
✅ Ticket audit trail logging (ticket_history table + observer)
✅ Purchase orders integration (table + FK relationships)
```
