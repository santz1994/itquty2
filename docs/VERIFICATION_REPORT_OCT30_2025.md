### 5. ✅ Serial Number Validation in Forms
**Status:** COMPLETE AND VERIFIED

**What Was Verified:**

  ```php
  Rule::unique('assets', 'serial_number')
      ->ignore($this->route('asset') ? $this->route('asset')->id : null)
      ->whereNotNull('serial_number')  // Key fix: allows multiple NULLs
  ```
  - File: `app/Http/Requests/StoreAssetRequest.php` - Lines 28-33
- ✅ AJAX validation endpoint exists and working:
  - Route: `GET /api/assets/check-serial` → `API\AssetController@checkSerial`
- ✅ Client-side validation implemented:
  - File: `resources/views/assets/create.blade.php` - Lines 202-218
  - Shows "Serial number already exists" in red if duplicate
  - Shows "Serial number available" in green if unique
  - Validation fires on blur event

**Acceptance Criteria - ALL MET:**
- ✅ Form shows error if serial exists (AJAX feedback working)

### 6. ⚠️ Foreign Key Constraints (PARTIAL)
**Status:** PARTIAL - NON-CRITICAL

**What Was Found:**
- ✅ Basic foreign keys exist: model_id, division_id, supplier_id
- ⚠️ onDelete rules not explicitly set (may default to RESTRICT)
- ⚠️ Migration created but has schema mismatch issues

**What Was Attempted:**
- Created migration: `2025_10_30_200000_fix_assets_foreign_key_constraints.php`
- Migration encountered schema issues (column type mismatches)
- **Decision:** Deferred as non-critical (basic FKs are working)

**Impact:** LOW
- Application functionality not affected
- Data integrity maintained by existing FKs
- Recommended for future enhancement
