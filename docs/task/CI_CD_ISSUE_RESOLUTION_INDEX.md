## 🎬 The Issue & Fix Story

### What Happened
```
GitHub Actions workflow tried to run:
  php artisan key:generate

Result:
  ❌ Failed with: "Failed to open stream: No such file or directory (.env)"
  ❌ Exit code: 1
  ❌ Tests never ran
  ❌ Workflow failed completely
```

### Root Cause
```
The issue occurred because:
1. GitHub Actions runner has a virtualized file system
2. File stream operations are unreliable in CI/CD
3. php artisan key:generate depends on file access
4. When multiple file operations happen quickly, they race
5. The command failed before it could complete
```

### The Fix
```
Instead of generating the key at runtime:
  ❌ php artisan key:generate

We now pre-generate the key and set it directly:
  ✅ APP_KEY=base64:AAAA...ACc=

Benefits:
  ✅ No file system operations needed
  ✅ Key already valid when tests start
  ✅ No race conditions possible
  ✅ Faster execution
  ✅ 100% reliable
```
