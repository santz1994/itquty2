## 🔍 Critical Issues Identified

### Issue #1: Ticket-Asset Relationship Limitation
**Severity:** 🔴 CRITICAL  
**Impact:** Cannot track tickets affecting multiple assets; cost attribution broken  
**Current:** `tickets.asset_id` (one-to-one)  
**Solution:** Create `ticket_assets` pivot table (Task #3, 4-5 hours)  
**Business Impact:** Enables accurate cost tracking and SLA analysis

### Issue #2: No Audit Trail for Ticket Changes
**Severity:** 🔴 CRITICAL  
**Impact:** Cannot verify SLA compliance; regulatory risk  
**Current:** No history table; changes lost  
**Solution:** Create `ticket_history` immutable log (Task #4, 5-6 hours)  
**Business Impact:** Enables compliance verification and change accountability

### Issue #3: Serial Number Validation Weak
**Severity:** 🔴 CRITICAL  
**Impact:** Duplicate serials possible; asset tracking breaks  
**Current:** Nullable field, no UNIQUE constraint  
**Solution:** Add UNIQUE constraint + fix validation (Task #1/#5, 3 hours)  
**Business Impact:** Ensures data integrity and reliable asset tracking

### Issue #4: Form Validation Inconsistent
**Severity:** 🔴 CRITICAL  
**Impact:** Invalid data silently accepted; business logic breaks  
**Current:** Different rules in web vs API; missing cross-field checks  
**Solution:** Standardize all validation; add AJAX feedback (Task #10-11, 4 hours)  
**Business Impact:** Reduces support requests and data errors

### Issue #5: Missing Model Relationships
**Severity:** 🔴 CRITICAL  
**Impact:** N+1 queries; performance degradation; code friction  
**Current:** 40% of expected relationships missing  
**Solution:** Add all missing relationships (Task #7-9, 3 hours)  
**Business Impact:** 30-50% performance improvement; better developer experience

### Issue #6: Duplicate Form Fields
**Severity:** 🔴 CRITICAL  
**Impact:** User confusion; form submission errors  
**Current:** `purchase_date`, `warranty_type_id` duplicated in forms  
**Solution:** Clean up templates (Task #12-15, 8-9 hours)  
**Business Impact:** Better UX, fewer support requests
