# ✅ SYSTEM FIXES COMPLETE - FINAL SUMMARY

## Overview
**All critical CRUD issues have been resolved and committed to master branch.**

Commit: `18f929e` - "Fix critical CRUD issues: User active column, Assets undefined vars, TicketsCannedFields undefined var"

---

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ User Table Column Mismatch - FIXED
**Problem:** Code used `active` column but database has `is_active`

**Error:** `SQLSTATE[42S22]: Column not found: 1054 Unknown column 'active' in 'where clause'`

**Files Fixed:**
- `app/Http/Controllers/BulkOperationController.php` (Line 409)
- `app/User.php` (Line 121)

**Impact:** All bulk operations now work (assign, status change, priority change, delete)

---

### 2. ✅ Assets Controller Undefined Variables - FIXED
**Problem:** Passed `$types` in compact() but never defined

**Error:** `HTTP 500: compact(): Undefined variable $types`

**File Fixed:**
- `app/Http/Controllers/AssetsController.php` (Lines 84-99)

**Impact:** `/assets` page now loads correctly with KPI cards

---

### 3. ✅ TicketsCannedFields Undefined Variable - FIXED
**Problem:** Referenced `$ticketsCannedFields` (plural) but only defined `$ticketsCannedField` (singular)

**Error:** `HTTP 500: compact(): Undefined variable $ticketsCannedFields`

**File Fixed:**
- `app/Http/Controllers/TicketsCannedFieldsController.php` (Line 66)

**Impact:** Ticket canned fields pages now work

---
